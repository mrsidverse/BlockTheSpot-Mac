## We need collaborators.

- We are running short of people who can collaborate and maintain this project. If you are good with bash scripting, please create an issue here or contact red.dev in discord.

### Features:

- Blocks all banner/video/audio ads within the app
- Blocks logging (Sentry, etc)
- Unlocks the skip function for any track
- Blocks Spotify automatic updates (optional)
- Hides podcasts, episodes and audiobooks on Home Screen (optional)
- Enable Developer Mode (optional)

### Installation/Update:

- Close Spotify completely.
- Run The following command in Terminal:

```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsidverse/BlockTheSpot-Mac/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```

#### Note:

- BlockTheSpot-Mac now requires codesign to sign the binaries after patching.
- For this, you will need to have Xcode installed on your mac.
- To install xcode, use the following command in terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
```

- If you have already installed xcode, you can skip this step.
- If you have Intel mac, you can try skipping codesign by using the `-S` flag.

#### Optional Install Arguments:

`-f` Force patch -- forces re-patching if backup detected  
`-h` Hide podcasts, episodes and audiobooks on home screen  
`-P` Path to Spotify.app -- set custom Spotify app path  
`-u` Block updated -- blocks automatic updates  
`-d` Enable Developer Mode  
`-S` Skip Codesign -- only to be used if you have intel mac  
`-U` Uninstall BlockTheSpot-Mac and restore original.

Use any combination of flags.  
The following example clears app cache, adds experimental features, leaves new UI enabled and blocks updates:

```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsidverse/BlockTheSpot-Mac/refs/heads/main/install.sh) -hu
```

### Uninstall:

- Close Spotify completely.
- Run The following command in Terminal:

```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nuzair46/BlockTheSpot-Mac/main/install.sh) -U
```

or

- Reinstall Spotify

### Notes:

- Audio/video ads during Podcast playback are currently NOT blocked with BlockTheSpot.
- Spicetify users: When using BlockTheSpot-Mac + Spicetify, the current script requires running BlockTheSpot first.

### DISCLAIMER

- Ad blocking is the main concern of this repo. Any other feature provided by BlockTheSpot-Mac or consequence of using those features will be the sole responsibility of the user, not BlockTheSpot/BlockTheSpot-Mac.
